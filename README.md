# PowerShell
Public PowerShell Script Gallery for some of my favorite scripts that helped solve some of the most repetitive, mundane, and utmost boring of tasks.

# Export Recursive AD Groups
This script takes a group as input from the command line, and it will loop through the group and output any members (groups/users). If it finds a group it will recursively loop through that group and also auto indent with a "TAB".
